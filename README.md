# **EMBEDDED SYSTEMS**
I completed this class at SNHU in June of 2025. We learned how to construct a Raspberry Pi 4 and connect to it remotely. We also learned the ins and outs of working with embedded systems. All assignments in this class were completed and tested using a breadboard!

## **Thermostat Lab Final Project**
This project was completed by wiring and utilizing an LED display, LED lights, three buttons, and a temperature & humidity sensor. We were also tasked with coding the Thermostat.py file. 
We had to take the thermostat sensors input and read it to the LED display. 
From there we could choose to change the temperature, similar to that of a thermostat. If you we changed the temperature (using the buttons) less than the current temp, then the blue LED light would pulse and the system would be set to "cooling". 
If we changed the temperature to greater than the current temp, then the red LED light would pulseand the system would be set to "heating". If the temperature matched the current temperature, the LED light would be solid. 

### **What did you do particularly well?**<br>
One area I feel I did particularly well in was implementing clear and functional control logic for the thermostat system. I made sure that the decision-making process for activating heating or 
cooling was both reliable and easy to follow. Additionally, I focused on code readability and organization, which made debugging and testing much smoother

### **Where could you improve?**<br>
While the project met its functional requirements, there are definitely areas that could be improved. The main thing that comes to mind is implementing more thorough error handling for unexpected sensor inputs or hardware failures that would increase system reliability.
Adding more the code in regards to temperature control logice as well would make it more scalable and easier to extend for additional features like  fan control or remote monitoring


**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**<br>
This project helped me learn and reinforce skills in hardware-software integration, control systems, and real-time problem-solving, all of which are applicable in future coursework involving embedded systems, robotics, or IoT development. 
The experience with writing clean, efficient C/C++ code and using microcontroller GPIOs is highly transferable to both academic and industry projects. This class has also opened me up to the world of embedded systems and I can confidently say that
I truly would like to pursue this area of engineering even further! 

**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**<br>
My project is written using clear naming conventions, inline comments, and modular functions that separate logic for readability. Configuration values, such as temperature thresholds, 
are stored in defined constants, making it easy to adjust system behavior without modifying core logic. The code is also structured so that new features could be integrated with minimal refactoring!
